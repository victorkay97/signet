// Deliberate public type surface for @signet/sdk.
//
// `@signet/types` is the shared, internal domain-type package consumed by
// every workspace (web, indexer, sdk, contracts tooling) — most of what it
// exports (handle-validation internals, `RESERVED_HANDLES`, the package's own
// `SIGNET_TYPES_VERSION` marker)
// exists for those internal consumers, not for SDK integrators. Blindly
// re-exporting all of it (`export *`) would make every one of those internal
// shapes part of this package's public npm contract, so a later internal
// refactor becomes a breaking change for external consumers who never asked
// for that shape in the first place.
//
// Only the types that actually appear in `SignetClient`'s method signatures
// are re-exported below. See `index.test.ts` for a regression test that
// fails if an internal export leaks back in.
